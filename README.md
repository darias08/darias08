<h1>Hello, üñêÔ∏è my name is Daniel Arias and I am <br/><a href="https://github.com/">Programmer</a>, <a href="">Cybersecurity Professional</a>


<h3> üë®‚Äçüíª About me:</h3>

I am a self-motivated learner who loves to explore the world of cybersecurity. The course of my time learning cybersecurity has made me love this field so much because of the ever-changing capabilities 
it holds when using technology. My goal in the field of cybersecurity is to help protect customers' and organization data from any malicious threat actors that are trying to steal SPII or PII information. The skills I have learned in 
cybersecurity are; Following the basic fundamentals of NIST Framework, using SIEM tools like Splunk or Chronicle to investigate any threats, navigating or configuring files with Linux, Filtering data with SQL queries, scanning for vulnerabilities on a network with Nmap, using a packet-sniffer called Wireshark, and updating a file using
Python.

My passion for technology and providing a secure environment has driven me to become a curious cybersecurity professional. What makes me stand out is my will to solve problems that are challenging or difficult. I am the type who would not give up on a situation when things feel challenging and I want to do everything I can to fix that problem until it has been completed. I am always ready to face challenges in cybersecurity and try to improve my skills in this industry. Thank you for taking the time to read about my experience in the world of cybersecurity and please reach out to me if you have any questions at danielarias999@hotmail.com. I would be delighted to speak with you!
